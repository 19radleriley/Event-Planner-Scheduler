## Desription: 
- Web App Designed for local non-profit "Aptiv" 
- Web App has following functionalities  
    1. Create / log into user accounts
    2. View and "volunteer" for upcoming events
    3. "Donate" to upcoming events 
    4. "Donate" to the Aptiv Organization

## **Important** Notes: 
- This was a team project
- I did most of the *front-end development* for the App
- Other team members implemented the backend

## Why?
- I am super interested in...  
    * Web design / development
    * Animation
    * Digital media / art
    * Computer graphics
- So this was right up my alley
- **I built this after learning html, css, and js for about 2-3 months**
